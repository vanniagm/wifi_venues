Correlations:
        
Visitor vs hour+weekday+month+branch office


It seems that theres no difference when comparing across months for the time sessions distributions (one dimen. box plot). It can only be compared using branch office 1

It seems that there's a difference on number of visits/non-visits (devices activted) across different days of the week and across different hours of the day

There is also dependance on the branch office (say location)

So we have

Visitor ~ hour+weekday+branch office


No missing values. (2nd and 3rd branches have missing data for October but that is not possible to fill, it would be different if just some days had missing values)



Training and Test

We have the test data given so I dont have t subset a dataset. For modeling I would divide the training data as: 70% for model bualding and 30% for model testing

I have to predict the visitors outcome (true or false) and branch office.

### Features
# The are not many features I will create new variables:

# 1. There may be users that are frequent clients, I will create a frequent variable for users
# or devices that appear twice on the period the data was collected (for different days on the total period of time).
# 2. I will convert Weekdays to binaries
# 3. I will convert branch_office to binaries
# 4. I will leave hour as categorical

# Large session time
